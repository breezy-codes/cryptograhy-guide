# Prime Numbers

In this section, you will find detailed explanations and examples on various topics related to prime numbers, including their properties, how to find coprime numbers, prime factorisation, the greatest common divisor (GCD), and the least common multiple (LCM).

## Introduction to Prime Numbers

Prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. In other words, a prime number is a number that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.

### For example:

    2 is a prime number because its only divisors are 1 and 2.
    3 is a prime number because its only divisors are 1 and 3.
    4 is not a prime number because it can be divided by 1, 2, and 4.

### Properties of Prime Numbers

    The number 2 is the only even prime number.
    Every prime number greater than 2 is odd.
    There are infinitely many prime numbers.

## Finding Coprimes

Two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. This means that they do not share any prime factors.

## Prime Factorization

Prime factorization is the process of breaking down a composite number into a product of prime numbers.

Example
- The prime factorization of $18$ is $2\times322\times32$.
- The prime factorization of $60$ is $22×3×522×3×5$.

## Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

The GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.

## Least Common Multiple (LCM)

The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.
