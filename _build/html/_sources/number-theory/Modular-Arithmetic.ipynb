    "\n",
    "Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers \"wrap around\" upon reaching a certain value called the modulus. It is a way to work with numbers that are too large to be represented in a computer's memory or too large to be manipulated using standard arithmetic operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "A great way to understand modular arithmetic is to think of a clock. The clock has 12 hours, and after 12 hours, it starts over at 1. This is an example of modular arithmetic with a modulus of 12."
