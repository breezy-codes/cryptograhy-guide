    "# **The Hill Cipher**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra. It was invented by Lester S. Hill in 1929. The cipher uses an $n \\times n$ matrix to encrypt blocks of $n$ letters at a time. The matrix must be invertible, and the determinant of the matrix must be coprime with the length of the alphabet. The matrix is multiplied by a vector of the plaintext to get the ciphertext. The inverse of the matrix is used to decrypt the ciphertext.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the process step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transformation of Letters to Numbers**:\n",
    "    - Each letter in the alphabet is assigned a number:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\begin{aligned}\n",
    "    A & = 0, \\\\\n",
    "    B & = 1, \\\\\n",
    "    \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "    Z & = 25.\n",
    "    \\end{aligned}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encryption Process**:\n",
    "    - Choose an $n \\times n$ matrix $K$ as the key for encryption. This matrix must be invertible modulo 26.\n",
    "    - Divide the plaintext into vectors of size $n$. For example, for a 2x2 matrix and plaintext \"HELP\":\n",
    "        \n",
    "    $$\\text{Plaintext: } \\text{HELP} \\rightarrow \\begin{pmatrix} H & E \\\\ L & P \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 7 & 4 \\\\ 11 & 15 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Multiply each vector by the matrix $K$ modulo 26 to get the ciphertext vector:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    $$\\text{Ciphertext vector: } C = K \\cdot P \\mod 26$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - For example, if $K = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 3 \\\\ 2 & 5 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $P = \\begin{pmatrix} 7 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$:\n",
    "        \n",

    "   \n",
    "    - The ciphertext corresponds to the letters $V$ and $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Decryption Process**:\n",
    "    - To decrypt, use the inverse of the matrix $K$, denoted as $K^{-1}$.\n",
    "    - Multiply the ciphertext vector by the inverse matrix $K^{-1}$ modulo 26 to get the plaintext vector:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    $$\\text{Plaintext vector: } P = K^{-1} \\cdot C \\mod 26$$\n",
