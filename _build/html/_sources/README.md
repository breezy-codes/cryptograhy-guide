# Welcome to the World of Cryptography!

Welcome to my Cryptography Projects project! This is where I will be sharing all the cool stuff I've been working on in the world of cryptography. It's an ongoing project that I will keep updating as I learn more and find the time to dive deeper. There’s no strict timeline here—it's built around my learning journey and time availability as a full-time student.

My passion for cryptography started in my first semester of university in Discrete Mathematics, where I wrote a HD report on the RSA algorith, DHKE algorithm and ECC. This continued into my second semester in my Cryptography subject, where I wrote a HD report on Quantum Cryptography and the Shor's algorithm. Both of these reports were featured in the **[Deakin Maths Yearbook 2023](https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-3336557334/view)**. I have since been exploring different cryptographic algorithms and concepts, and I'm excited to share my findings with you.


## About This Project

This project is a collection of my work in cryptography, presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks. Each notebook explores different aspects of cryptography, from theoretical mathematical foundations to practical implementations in Python. You’ll find detailed explanations of the mathematics behind cryptographic algorithms, along with code snippets to illustrate how these concepts are applied.

## What you will find here

Here are some of the topics I have covered or intend to cover in this  project:

- The concepts of number theory that underpin many cryptographic algorithms
- Different Ciphers such as Caesar Cipher, Vigenère Cipher, and Hill Cipher
- Symmetric Key Cryptographic Algorithms such as DES, AES, and others
- Asymmetric Key Cryptographic Algorithms such as RSA, ElGamal, ECC and others
- Hash functions such as MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256
- Quantum Cryptography and its applications
- Digital Signatures and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

## How to Use This Project

You can browse the project, or download the GitHub repository and run the Jupyter notebooks on your local machine. Each notebook is self-contained and can be read independently, but I recommend starting with the introductory notebooks if you are new to cryptography. Feel free to explore the topics that interest you the most, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or feedback.

### To Download the github repository:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/breezy-codes/cryptography-guide.git
```

2. Navigate to the directory with the following command:

```bash
cd cryptography-guide
```

3. Create a venv and install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Contributions

I welcome contributions to this project! If you have any suggestions, corrections, or new topics you would like to see covered, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I am always looking to improve the content and make it more accessible to a wider audience.
