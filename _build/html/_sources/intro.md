# Welcome to the World of Cryptography!


Welcome to my Cryptography Projects repository! This is where I’ll be sharing all the cool stuff I've been working on in the world of cryptography. It's an ongoing project that I’ll keep updating as I learn more and find the time to dive deeper. There’s no strict timeline here—it's built around my learning journey and time availability as a full-time student.

Everything here is written in Python, based on the cryptographic concepts I've picked up along the way. From encryption and decryption to key generation and digital signatures, you'll find a variety of projects that showcase different aspects of cryptography.

Some interesting work I've done so far includes the **[Deakin Maths Yearbook 2023](https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-3336557334/view)** where I was the first person to be in the Yearbook twice, as well as twice in the same year for my Cryptography report and another Quantum Cryptography report.

I’m always learning, so expect to see new projects pop up as I explore new ideas and techniques. Whether you’re here to learn, or just check out what I’ve been up to, I hope you find something interesting and useful in this repository.
