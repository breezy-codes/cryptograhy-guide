# Prime Numbers

In this section, you will find detailed explanations and examples on various topics related to prime numbers, including their properties, how to find coprime numbers, prime factorisation, the greatest common divisor (GCD), and the least common multiple (LCM).

## Introduction to Prime Numbers

Prime numbers are natural numbers greater than $1$ that have no positive divisors other than $1$ and themselves. In other words, a prime number is a number that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.

### For example:

- $2$ is a prime number because its only divisors are $1$ and $2$.
- $3$ is a prime number because its only divisors are $1$ and $3$.
- $4$ is not a prime number because it can be divided by $1$, $2$, and $4$.

### Properties of Prime Numbers

- The number $2$ is the only even prime number.
- Every prime number greater than $2$ is odd.
- There are infinitely many prime numbers.
