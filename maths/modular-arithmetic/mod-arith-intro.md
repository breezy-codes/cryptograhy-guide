# Modular Arithmetic

In this section, you will find detailed explanations and examples on various topics related to modular arithmetic, including modular addition, modular subtraction, modular multiplication, modular division, and modular exponentiation.

## Introduction to Modular Arithmetic

Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers "wrap around" upon reaching a certain value called the modulus. In modular arithmetic, two numbers are considered equivalent if they have the same remainder when divided by the modulus.

### For example:

- In modulo $5$ arithmetic, $7$ is equivalent to $2$ because both have a remainder of $2$ when divided by $5$.
- In modulo $12$ arithmetic, $15$ is equivalent to $3$ because both have a remainder of $3$ when divided by $12$.
