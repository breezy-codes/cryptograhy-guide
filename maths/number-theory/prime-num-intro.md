## Introduction to Prime Numbers

Prime numbers are natural numbers greater than $1$ that have no positive divisors other than $1$ and themselves. In simpler terms, a prime number is a number that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.

### For Example:

- **$2$** is a prime number because its only divisors are $1$ and $2$.
- **$3$** is a prime number because its only divisors are $1$ and $3$.
- **$4$** is not a prime number because it can be divided by $1$, $2$, and $4$.

### Properties of Prime Numbers

- **The number $2$ is the only even prime number:** All other even numbers can be divided by $2$, so they cannot be prime.
- **Every prime number greater than $2$ is odd:** This is because even numbers greater than $2$ can always be divided by $2$.
- **There are infinitely many prime numbers:** This was proven by the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid.

## Why Study Prime Numbers?

Prime numbers play a crucial role in various fields of mathematics and computer science, particularly in number theory and cryptography. They are the building blocks of the integers, and understanding their properties can help solve a wide range of mathematical problems.
